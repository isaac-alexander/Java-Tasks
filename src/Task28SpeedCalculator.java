//Write a Java program to take the user for a distance (in meters) and the time taken (as three numbers: hours, minutes, seconds), and display the speed, in meters per second, kilometers per hour and miles per hour (hint: 1 mile = 1609 meters). Computer programming courses
//Input distance in meters: 2500
//Input hour: 5
//Input minutes: 56
//Input seconds: 23
//Expected Output :
//Your speed in meters/second is 0.11691531
//Your speed in km/h is 0.42089513
//Your speed in miles/h is 0.26158804

        // Compute speed in meters/second
        // Compute speed in kilometers/hour
